# Completed Features

## 1. QADL Syntax and Semantics
- Partially defined syntax for describing quantum circuits including qubits, gates, and measurements.

## 2. QADL Parser
- Implemented a parser that reads QADL scripts and identifies circuit components.
- Basic syntax validation included.

## 3. QADL Executor
- Executes parsed QADL scripts and simulates quantum circuits.
- Generates visualizations of the circuits.
- Integrated with Qiskit for circuit execution.
- Handles basic quantum gates and measurements.

## 4. QADL GUI
- Provides a graphical user interface for writing and visualizing QADL scripts.
- Features include script editing, running, clearing, and saving.

## 5. Visualization Tools
- Generates circuit diagrams using Qiskit and PIL.
- Displays diagrams in the GUI.

## 6. Example QADL Scripts
- Provided sample scripts for common quantum circuits and algorithms.
- Files: `example.qadl`, `QADL_Help_Demo.qadl`

## 7. Error Handling in GUI
- Displays syntax and runtime errors in the GUI.

## 8. Basic Export Functionality
- Allows exporting visualized circuits in PNG, JPG, and PDF formats.
